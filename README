NAME
    Vroom::Vroom - Slide Shows in Vim

SYNOPSIS
        > vim slides.vroom  # Write Some Slides
        > vroom --vroom     # Show Your Slides

DESCRIPTION
    Ever given a Slide Show and needed to switch over to the shell?

    Now you don't ever have to switch again. You're already there.

    Vroom lets you create your slides in a single file using a Wiki-like
    style, much like Spork and Sporx do. The difference is that your slides
    don't compile to HTML or JavaScript or XUL. They get turned into a set
    of files that begin with '0', like '03' or '07c' or '05b.pl'.

    The slides are named in alpha order. That means you can bring them all
    into a Vim session with the command: "vim 0*". "vroom --vroom" does
    exactly that.

    Vroom creates a file called "./.vimrc" with many helpful key mappings
    for navigating a slideshow. See "KEY MAPPINGS" below. Please note that
    you will need the following line in your "$HOME/.vimrc" file in order to
    pickup the local ".vimrc" file.

    Vroom takes advantage of Vim's syntax highlighting. It also lets you run
    slides that contain code.

    Since Vim is an editor, you can change your slides during the show.

COMMAND USAGE
    Vroom has a few command line options:

    vroom
        Just running vroom will compiles 'slides.vroom' into slide files.

    vroom --vroom
        Compile and start vim show.

    vroom --clean
        Clean up all the compiled output files.

INPUT FORMAT
    Here is an example slides.vroom file:

        ---- config
        # These are YAML settings for Vroom
        title: My Spiffy Slideshow
        height: 84
        width: 20
        # skip: 12      # Skip 12 slides. Useful when making slides.
        ---- center
        My Presentation

        by Ingy
        ----
        == Stuff I care about:

        * Foo
        +* Bar
        +* Baz
        ---- perl,i10
        # Perl code indented 10 spaces
        use Vroom::Vroom;

        print "Hello World";
        ---- center
        THE END

KEY MAPPINGS
    <SPACE>
        Advance one slide.

    <BACKSPACE>
        Go back one slide.

    <R> Run current slide as Perl.

    <Q> Quit Vroom.

NOTE
    Vroom is called Vroom but the module is Vroom::Vroom because the CPAN
    shell sometimes thinks Vroom is Tim Vroom, and it refuses to install
    him.

    Use a shell command like this to install Vroom:

        sudo cpan Vroom::Vroom
